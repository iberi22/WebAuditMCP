**Optimized for local development servers - fast feedback in under 1 minute**

## Quick Development Audit

Using WebAuditMCP, perform a fast development audit of the localhost URL:

### Phase 1: Instant Checks (< 10 seconds)
1. Run `security_headers` to check HTTP security headers
2. Run `health_check` to verify all tools are working

### Phase 2: Fast Visual/UX Audit (< 30 seconds)
